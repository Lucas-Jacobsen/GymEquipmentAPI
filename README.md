# GymEquipmentAPI

This is the backend API for my Angular and React inventory management projects. The API is written in Node.js and Express.js using Typescript. It uses MySQL for the database. The API is RESTful and uses JSON for data exchange. It is a simple API that allows for CRUD operations on a database of inventory items.
